## Data Table

### Used internally by

Data Table is used to populate values for various Data List providers, namely User-defined List and the HTML attributes for both Dropdown List and Templated List.


### Future scope

It has future scope to be a standalone property-editor.

However I'm not happy with the current implementation, especially the UI. I would consider re-developing this editor.
